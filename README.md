# vue-line-graph

## Requirement

- Attached is a figma file and a json file.
- We'd like to see how you'd go about creating a Vue 3 JS component that renders the designed graph with interactions (
  hover/press and date highlighting) along with the maths to track spending.
- The data provided is the bare minimum necessary to complete the task though if you feel that more fields would improve
  the performance it would be great to hear your opinion on it.
-  The gradient fill under the line is a "nice to have".
-  For MVP focus on data manipulation and spending tracking. The design shows 7 days, there are 31 days of data attached.

You can use any graphing implementation you wish, including pure js.

The multiple data points within each date is a transaction for that date, this is to be rendered in aggregate for the date. Some dates have no transactions.
